      <h1>Floating Therapy</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        Floating therapy is a deeply restorative practice where you float
        effortlessly in warm, mineral-rich water designed to reduce
        external stimulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The water is saturated with Epsom salt, creating natural buoyancy
        so your body can fully relax without effort. Heated to skin temperature,
        the experience gently dissolves the boundary between body and water,
        allowing the nervous system to slow down and reset.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s a quiet space for rest, recovery, and mental clarity.
      </p>

      <h2>A Calm State of Being</h2>
      <p>
        By minimizing sensory input, floating can guide the body into a naturally
        relaxed state. Many people leave a session feeling lighter, clearer,
        and more grounded.
      </p>

        <li>Promotes deep physical relaxation</li>
      </ul>
